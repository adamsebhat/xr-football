          Football rewards outcomes. But outcomes are noisy. A goalkeeper pulls off a wonder save,
          a shot clips the post, a referee awards a soft penalty — and a dominant performance
          ends in a loss. The <strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Expected Result</strong> is our
          best estimate of what{" "}
          <em style={{ color: "var(--red)" }}>should have happened</em>, built from the
          quality and quantity of chances created, not the final scoreline.

             quality of their performances: how many good chances they created (xGF) and conceded (xGA),
             their possession share, crossing threat, press intensity, and defensive solidity.`,
            `Recent form is weighted more heavily using an exponential decay: the most recent
             4 games count roughly 4× as much as games from 10 fixtures ago. This captures
             current momentum — an injury to a key striker, a new manager's tactical change,
             a run of easy opponents — without ignoring the broader context.`,

             its location, angle, assist type, and body part. A tap-in from 6 yards has an xG of ~0.8;
             a speculative long-range effort might be 0.04.`,
            `Our matchup model builds on top of raw xG. We compare how each team's attacking
             profile meets the opponent's defensive profile. A team with high crossing threat
             playing against a team with poor aerial defence generates higher xG than the
             raw numbers would suggest. We adjust for:`,

             tells us the probability of them scoring exactly 0, 1, 2, 3… goals in this match.`,
