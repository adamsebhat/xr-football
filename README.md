# The xRphilosophy

**Premier League analytics built on Expected Results — not the scoreline.**

Season: 2025-26 · Data via ESPN API

---

## What is xR?

The **Expected Result** is what *should have happened* in a football match, based on the quality and quantity of chances created — not the final score. A team can dominate possession, create 3.1 xG, and still lose 1-0 to a breakaway goal. The scoreline lies. xR doesn't.

This app models the 2025-26 Premier League using:

- **Rolling Form** — last 10 matches, exponential-weighted (recent 4× heavier)
- **Matchup xG** — pressing vs. pass completion, crossing threat vs. aerial defence, possession dominance vs. counter threat
- **Poisson Model** — xG → probability distribution → Win/Draw/Loss % and top scoreline predictions
- **Expected Points (xPts)** — 3×P(Win) + 1×P(Draw), surfacing who is lucky and who is unlucky

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
python3 scripts/fetch_espn_2526.py   # fetch real data
npm run dev                           # http://localhost:3000
```

## Update Data

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_espn_2526.py
```

Fetches all 380 fixtures from the ESPN API, refreshes the last 30 days with live scores, runs the xR model, and saves to `data/processed/`.
